### Lab 1: Familiarize Yourself With Lenses UI

Step 1: Log in and explore. Your instructor will have assigned you a Lenses URL with login information. Go to that URL and login. You will see a welcome screen you can dismiss for now, but if you are brand new to Lenses this is a great resource for further information.

The first screen you see is the Environments screen. This is a listing of all the connected Kafka environments. For training purposes we will be working with an "on-prem" open source Kafka labedled Dev and a staging environment using Strimzi in the cloud.
